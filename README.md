# PRODUCTION LEVEL PROGRAMMING


This document is a collection of all my  notes and instructions on different
frameworks and programming languages that I use. Feel free to look over it.

If something doesn't make sense it is probably a note I added quickly but never
got back to adding more details.

# TODO
- [ ] Add a programming language learing section where I add common tasks or
      functions that help you learn that language. Then I can list out
      examples of how to do that function in the new language I am learning.
      So for example I could show how to do a for loop in python and then I
      could have code to do the same loop in sql or scala.
- [ ] Make table of contents that point to different repositories
