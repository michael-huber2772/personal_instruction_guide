|-|-|-|-|
| Popultaion | A group of people sharing something in common | Is the entire set of existing units (people, objects, or events) that you wish to stody or know about. |  |
| Variable | Something that can change in an equation | A measurable characteristic of the population. |  |
| Census | A poll | is an examination of the entire population of measurements. |  |
| Sample | Testing part of something, to get an idea about the rest of it. | is a subset of a population |  |
| Simple Random Sample |  | A sample where every element of the population has an equal chance of being in the sample. |  |
| Parameter  | Rules or boundaries | Is a number calculated from all the population measurements that describes some aspect of the population. |  |
| Statistic | Numerical data in reference to something | A number calculated from the measurements taken from a sample. |  |
| Estimate | An educated guess | A point estimate is a sample statistic that is used to estimate a parameter |  |
| Nominal Data |  | Also called Categorical data, or qualitative data.  The answer to a question for which you have to apply a word. Values are either words/ phrases or arbitrary numbers that represent categories.  -Can only calculate frequencies of occurrence. |  |
| Ordinal data | Data that comes in an order. | Values must represent the ranked order of the data.  -Calculations based on an ordering process are valid.  - Data may be treated as nominal but not as interval. |  |
| Interval data | data with peaks and valleys | Values are real numbers.  - All calculations are valid.  - Data may be treated as ordinal or nominal. |  |
| Mode  | A certain way of being |  |  |
| Range | A series of possibilities for the answers | Distance between the largest observation and the smallest observation.  Simplest and quickest way to measure variability.  |  |
| Variance | A changing amount | Is the average of the squares deviation. |  |
| Median | A type of Average | The value of the middle point of the ordered measurements. -Average of the squared differences of the mean. |  |
| Mean | A type of Average | The average or "expected value.  Add up all of the values and divide by how many there are. Mean and average mean the same thing so the teacher will use them interchangeably | âˆ‘ represents the summation, X represents scores, and N represents the number of scores |
| Deviation | A change from the given path | Take each number on a list and subtract the average.  This is its deviation. - The distance of an observation in a data set from the mean of the data set.  Deviations are negative if the observation is less than the mean, and positive if the observation is more than the mean.  |  |
| Measures of Center |  | The four measures of center are mean, median, mode and midrange. |  |
| Measures of Variability |  | Statisticians use summary measures to describe the amount of variability or spread in a set of data. The most common measures of variability are the range, the interquartile range (IQR), variance, and standard deviation. |  |
| Interquartile Range |  | is the difference between Q3 and Q1 | Range = max-min, IQR = Q3-Q1pa |
| Independent | Module2 | two events are independent if the occurrence of one of the events gives us no information about whether or not the other event will occur; that is, the events have no influence on each other. |  |
| Complement | How to things inter-relate to one antoher. | of an event is the opposite of that event, that is, every outcome in the sample space that is not in the event. |  |
| Experiment |  | Any process or study which results in the collection of data, the outcome of which is unknown prior to the collection of the data.  In statistics, the term is usually restricted to situations in which the researcher has control over some of the conditions under which the experiment takes place. |  |
| Intersection |  | The intersection of events A and B is the event containing all sample points that are in both A and B. |  |
| Exclusive |  |  |  |
| Event |  | Any outcome or combination of outcomes of a random experiment. |  |
| Union |  | The union of events A and B is the event containing all sample points that are in A or B or both.  |  |
| Outcome |  | is the result of an experiment or other situation involving uncertainty.  The set of all possible outcomes of a probability experiment is called a sample space.  |  |
| Probability |  | Can be a measure of likelihood.  This can be graphed with numbers from 0 to 1.  The closer it is to one the more likely it is to occur.  0 is impossible.  The measure of likelihood  of an event or outcome. | Probability as a fraction: Probability = # of desired outcomes/ # of total possible outcomes.    Probability as Frequency- The probability of an event is the frequency with which the event occurs over time, expressed as a proportion or as a percentage.  Probability = Desired quantity / Total quantity. |
| Random |  | A random experiment is any process of observation with an uncertain outcome. |  |
| Sample Space |  | The list of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.  Ex. In tossing a coin, the sample space is (heads, or tails).  These are the possible outcomes. |  |
| Mutually Exclusive  |  | Events A and b are mutually exclusive if they have no sample points in common.  Also called disjoint. |  |
| Given |  | Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has occurred. For example, the probability of John doing mathematics at A-Level, given that he is doing physics may be quite high. P(A. \| B) means the probability of A occurring, given that B has occurred. |  |
| Random Variable |  | A numerical outcome of a random process. |  |
| Discrete |  | Data that can only be integer values. |  |
| Continuous  |  | Data that can be any real number |  |
| Discrete Random Variable |  | A numerical ooutcome of a random process that produces only integer vaules. |  |
| Continuos Random variable  |  | A numerical outcome of a random process that can produce any real number values. |  |
| Binomial |  | A random variable that counts the number of successes in n independent trials. |  |
