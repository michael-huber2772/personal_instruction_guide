# Location For Files in Datadump
Given a location where I can copy database files when doing data dumps in order
to load the data into the database. But the location doesn't exist in my
version of couchdb so I will have to research more when I get to this point.

# Accessing the Database
+ http://localhost:5984/_utils/index.html#/_all_dbs

# Querying the Database
The query language for couchdb is Javascript
