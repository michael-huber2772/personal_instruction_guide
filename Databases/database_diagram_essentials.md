# Database Diagramming Essentials

## Conceptual Model
**Conceptual Model:** “...the first stage in the database design process.  
The goal at this stage is to design a database that is independent of database 
software and  physical details. The output of this process is a conceptual data 
model that describes the  main data entities, attributes, relationships, and 
constraints of a given problem domain.  This design is descriptive and narrative 
in form. In other words, it is generally composed  of a graphical representation 
as well as textual descriptions of the main data elements,  relationships, and constraints.  
In this stage, data modeling is used to create an abstract database structure 
that represents real-world objects in the most realistic way possible. The 
conceptual model must  embody a clear understanding of the business and its 
functional areas. At this level of  abstraction, the type of hardware and 
database model to be used might not have been  identified yet. Therefore, the 
design must be software- and hardware-independent so that  the system can be set
up within any platform chosen later.”

## Logical Model
**Logical design:**  “ … the second stage in the database design process. The 
logical design  goal is to design an enterprise-wide database that is based on a
specific data model but  independent of physical-level details. Logical design 
requires that all objects in the conceptual model be mapped to the specific 
constructs used by the selected database model.  For example, the logical design 
for a relational DBMS includes the specifications for  the relations (tables), 
relationships, and constraints (in other words, domain definitions,  data 
validations, and security views).”

## Physical Model
**Physical design:** “... the process of determining the data storage 
organization and data  access characteristics of the database to ensure its 
integrity, security, and performance.  This is the last stage in the database 
design process. The storage characteristics are a function of the types of 
devices supported by the hardware, the type of data access methods  supported by 
the system, and the DBMS. Physical design can become a very technical  job that 
affects not only the accessibility of the data in the storage device(s) but the 
performance of the system. “
