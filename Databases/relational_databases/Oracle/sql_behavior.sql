/*==============================================================================
                MINUS STATEMENT APPLIED TO MULTIPLE UNIONS
================================================================================
The goal of this code was to show that a minus statement at the bottom of a list
of UNION ALL's would remove data from an earlier union without needing
parenthesis to specify the order of operations.

OUTPUT
-------
1
3

Which proved that a parenthesis was not needed around all of the select
statements being UNIONed together.
