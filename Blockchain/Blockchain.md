# Blockchain

## Important Concepts to Know

Definitions from below are provided in the following [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_blockchain/python_blockchain_introduction.htm)

Components Involved in Blockchain Project Development
The entire blockchain project development consists of three major components −

+ Client
+ Miners
+ Blockchain

Client   

The Client is the one who will buy goods from other vendors. The client himself 
may become a vendor and will accept money from others against the goods he 
supplies. We assume here that the client can both be a supplier and a recipient 
of TPCoins. Thus, we will create a client class in our code that has the ability 
to send and receive money.

Miner   

The Miner is the one who picks up the transactions from a transaction pool and 
assembles them in a block. The miner has to provide a valid proof-of-work to get 
the mining reward. All the money that miner collects as a fee will be for him to 
keep. He may spend that money on buying goods or services from other registered 
vendors on the network, just the way a Client described above does.

Blockchain

Finally, a Blockchain is a data structure that chains all the mined blocks in a 
chronological order. This chain is immutable and thus temper-proof.

The first block in a blockchain is known as the `Genesis block`. The geneisis
block contains the first transaction initiated by the createor of the blockchain


## Smart Contract
Code or an automated process that handles a transaction between two parties
without a middleman.

Example:
You put your will in a smart contract and then upon your death. The program and
not a third party would handle your will. Anywhere, where a transaction needs
to occur you can use a smart contract.



Cryptocurrency

Blockchain - a unique form of database that allows cryptocurrencies to work. It stores and facilitates transaction information. Most cryptocurrencies would have their own blockchain database with their own set of rules.
Distributed Database
Entries are immutable. E.g. data cannot be deleted
In a blockchain database a copy of the database resides on every computer that participates in the blockchain.

To give something value it must be scarce. Only 21 million bitcoins ever created. 
Periodically new bitcoins are released and they can be acquired by solving extremely complicated mathematical puzzles. They take a lot of computing power so access is limited. Because it incurs a cost for miners to be able to access them.

If demand for bitcoin is high the price increases. If demand is low the price drops.
