# Data Structures
Data structure is a collection of data items used to pass data to other
components of the same application or to another application.It can also pass
data from a user to an application.
+ std::vector - flexible data structure that allows random reads and writes
+ Arrays - flexible data structure that allows random reads and writes
+ STL container classes
+ Linked Lists
+ Stacks
+ Queues

## Arrays
Collection of elements stored at adjacent memory locations. Structures that can
hold data for the same data type and are fixed in length. Be it an array of 
integers, strings, or even an array of an array. These arrays have indexes which 
means they can be accessed randomly by providing the index of the position. Each
of the elements is stored in memory with a specific address that can be used to
retrieve the element back. The last element in an array is always NULL

## Stacks
+ Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) - The new element is added at the end of the 
  stack. Two operations for LIFO
  - push - append an elment to the end of the container
  - pop - remove the most recent element from the container


## Queues
+ First-In-First-Out (FIFO) First element added will be the first to go. 
  basic operations
  - enqueue - append an element to the end of the container
  - dequeue - remove the first element from the container
