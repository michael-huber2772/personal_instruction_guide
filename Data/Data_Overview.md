# Data

* Many data points make up a data set. A data set can be broken into variables.
  Which most times are the columns of a table.
* Quantitative Data - Data that is represented by numbers or quantities.

# Types of Data in Statistics and Research
* Quantitative Data
* Qualitative Data

# Types of Data and How to Handle it (Ref 1)
Many of these data types may overlap or be the same thing with similar names.
I am just adding the information here as I study.

1. Big Data (data that will not practically fit into a relational database)
2. Structured, unstructured, semi-structured data
3. Time-stamped data
4. Machine Data
5. Spatiotemporal data
6. Open Data
7. Dark Data (data not being used)[I don't thinnk I would consider this a type
   of data].
8. Real time data
9. Genomics data
10. Operational Data
11. High-dimensional data
12. Unverified outdated data
13. Translytic Data
14. Decision Support Data
15. Operational Data

# Types of Data
1. Character Data
2. Numeric Data
3. Date Data

# Data Profiling
I believe that in regards to how data behaves that there is a finite amount of
behaviors it must have so I believe that there must be a way to profile data
sets. If I can profile data sets then I should be able to set standard coding
standards of how to handle that data. Now I know I have read about type 1 and
type 2 changes to data and I believe that, that will be part of the profiling.
There also may already be a system out there for profiling. So if I find one
I will try and switch over to that system. For now I am just going to record
different types of data that I encounter.
* Data that records historical events. So it has a day or term when it becomes
  effective but back dated data can be inserted.

## Questions to Research
-[ ] What type of data can a transactional database create. Can this be broken
     down into specific domains or descriptions.
