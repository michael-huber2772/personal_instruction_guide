# REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION
---
|Item|Description|Notes|
|-|-|-|
|Subject Area Description|Defines the subject area and maps it to familiar business processes|This can usually be accomplished in one or two sentences|
|Roles|States the interest each department or user group has in the subject area|This helps prevent subject areas from being confused with departments. Single phrases or short sentences should do the job.|
|Analytic Requirements|Statements describing the kinds of measurements and level of details|These statements will strike you as similar to grain statements for fact tables, but here they express very specific business requirements|
|Process Measurement|Specific breakdown of measurements, broken into group sby process along with associated dimensional context|These statements detail the facts associated with each analytic requirement, as well as the major dimensions of analysis|
