Remember for ETL diagrams you need 3 type:
PDD - Process Dependency Diagram: Shows the sequence of execution and dependency for a bunch of ETL processes.
DFD - Data Flow Diagram: Show how the data is flowing from one table or file to another. (You can even create data mapping document in excel)
ETL Design: Shows how the data is being processing by a single ETL process. ex. read, filter, lookup, join, aggregate and load.
