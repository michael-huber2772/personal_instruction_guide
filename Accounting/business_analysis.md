### Return On Investment (ROI)
ROI - Is a measure of the profitabiltiy of gaining a return on an investment
compared to the cost of that investment.

ROI, internal rate of return (IRR), and net present value (NPV) are cash flow
measures can be used to evaluate and rank the attractiveness of a number of
different investments.

#### Calculating ROI
There are two different methods of calculating ROI.
First Method:
$$
ROI = \frac{\text{Net Return On Investment}}{\text{Cost Of Investment}} 
\times 100 \%
$$

Second Method:
$$
ROI = \frac{\text{Final Value of Investment - Initial Value of Investment}}
{\text{Cost Of Investment}} 
\times 100 \%
$$

##### Interpreting ROI
"When ROI calculations yield a positive figure, it means that net returns are in
the black (because total returns exceed total costs). Alternatively, when ROI 
calculations yield a negative figure, it means that net returns are in the red 
because total costs exceed total returns. (In other words, this investment 
produces a loss.) Finally, to calculate ROI with the highest degree of accuracy,
total returns and total costs should be considered." [Investopedia Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/10/guide-to-calculating-roi.asp)
