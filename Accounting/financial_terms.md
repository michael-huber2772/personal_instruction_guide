# Financial Term Definitions

+ **Fungibility** - Fungibility is the ability of a good or asset to be 
  interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. Fungible 
  assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, as fungibility implies equal 
  value between the assets.
+ **Security** - a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some 
  type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded 
  corporation via stock; a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a 
  corporation represented by owning that entity's bond; or rights to ownership as 
  represented by an option.
