# Cryptocurrency

**Blockchain** - a unique form of database that allows cryptocurrencies to work. 
It stores and facilitates transaction information. Most cryptocurrencies would 
have their own blockchain database with their own set of rules.
+ Distributed Database
+ Entries are immutable. E.g. data cannot be deleted
In a blockchain database a copy of the database resides on every computer that 
participates in the blockchain.

To give something value it must be scarce. Only 21 million bit coins ever 
created. 
Periodically new bitcoins are released and they can be acquired by solving 
extremely complicated mathematical puzzles. They take a lot of computing power 
so access is limited. Because it incurs a cost for miners to be able to access 
them.

If demand for bitcoin is high the price increases. If demand is low the price 
drops

Managing a cryptocurrency is a long term commitment.

Some companies have been creating cyptocurrencies to raise capital for running
their business. Similar to an IPO these are called ICO. So it seems like it is
similar to selling stock in a company to raise money. Except you don't get any 
ownership in the business. Instead you are relying on the value of the crypto
to increase so you make money.

## Howey Test
1. Is there an expectation that the purchased toekn will make money for the
   investor?
2. Do the management of the enterprise providing the token work to make its 
   value increase.

If the answer to both of these question is **YES** then the item being offered
is a security.

Cryptocurrencies are not always a security.

# The Mining Process
* Mining is a process that enables concensus

* Your computer is used to solve a complicated math formula. As more miners
  enter the market the complexity of the equations goes up and so does the cost
  of the hardware you need to solve the equation. For bitcoin now home computers
  are not powerful enough. Smaller currencies though you can still use a home
  computer.

  You have to figure out the cost of all your hardware and the cost of powering
  it to see if mining is the right fit for you.

  There is software available that will allow you to switch your mining rig to
  coins that are more profitable.
